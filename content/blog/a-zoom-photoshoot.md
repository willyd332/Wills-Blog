**It was the fourth day of my remote internship at Viget. But It was the first day I had worn pants**. Video meetings have the sneaky benefit of only revealing a portion of the truth. If you angle the webcam right you can conceal the lower half of your body, your messy desk, and all sorts of dirty laundry (including your literal dirty laundry). But on the fourth day of my internship I did my laundry and put my pants on.
 
That day, I was preparing to take my company photo. All of Viget's employees had one of their own. Posed confidently in full business-casual attire, their welcoming smiles seemed to say *"Hello friend. We love it here at Viget and you would too."* As I imagined myself standing where they stood, a well-lit office kitchen that undoubtedly provided bottomless coffee (kombucha?), healthy snacks, and a microwave to warm my tupperware lunches, how could I disagree?

But reality is harsh. I didn't know if I'd ever experience the Vigety glory unique to DC, Durham, Chattanooga, and Boulder. I decided I would do my best to recreate it in my little apartment. I threw on a nice button-down shirt (forgetting to tuck it in) and my best pair of pants. I opened my window, trying to mimic the Viget office's natural light, and mournfully observed a group of CU Boulder students with a different kind of Natural Lightâ„¢.
 
I admit that I was nervous when the call came in. It was from my photo-director who would guide me through the process. After great pains, I managed to prop my phone up on a stack of books, balanced on a guitar case, sitting on a chair, resting against the window. He told me to set a timer on my phone and stand back a few steps. I clicked the photo button.
 
**10...** I step back **9...** I realize that I haven't decided on a pose **8...** I panic and stand at attention like a soldier **7...** Wait! This is dumb, everyone was so relaxed in their photos **6...** Okay, relax. Deep breath. **5...** Good, now smile **4...** But no teeth! **3...** Oh no! What about my hands? **2...** I guess they go on my hips? **1...\*CLICK\***
 
"Perfect," said my photo-director, "Send it over." I didn't agree with him at all. In the photo, I was standing, an unmade bed in the background, with my hands on my hips like some superhero (Wolverintern). But, who was I to say? I figured they would edit it, crop out the messy bed and untucked shirt, and maybe even green-screen me into the Viget office. So I sent it and that's the end of the story.
 
The next day, during FLF, a company wide Viget meeting, I was asked to introduce myself to everyone. Easy enough, I thought. But to my horror, as they announced my name, there it was: the picture I had taken the day before in all its glory, unmade bed and all. Shared from the presenter's screen I knew that everyone in the company was looking at it on their monitors. Luckily no one mentioned it. Better to just forget about it.
